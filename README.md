# Mo-s-Hello-World
The time has finally come to reposit the tory!
I have stolen the identity of my niece because she resembles me when I was her age and I thought it was cool.
I am 56 years old and my life is just beginning. I don't understand why, but it is. I am so excited!
I have come by the understanding the world has not changed but I have. That being said: I know the Universe has plans.
Why not!!
